We'll implement JWT-based authentication to manage user sessions and roles.

Signup and Login: Users (buyers, vendors) can sign up, and staff are created by the admin.
Passwords should be hashed using bcrypt for secure storage.
On login, a JWT token is returned for authenticated users.
Authentication Flow
Signup:

For buyers/vendors: Register their information and assign a role (vendor or user).
Admin creates staff accounts manually.
Login:

Users log in with their credentials. If the credentials are valid, a JWT token is generated, containing their role and user details.
JWT Token:
The JWT token will include user information and role for authorization checks.

API Endpoints for Authentication
POST /auth/signup – Register a new user.
POST /auth/login – Login and generate a token.
