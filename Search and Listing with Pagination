Implement a search endpoint that allows filtering products based on parameters like name, category, or vendor.
Pagination must be implemented on the server-side to handle large datasets.

API for Search and Listing
  GET /products/search â€“ Search for products based on query parameters (name, category, etc.)
    Support query parameters for pagination like page and limit.
Pagination Logic
In the backend, we can use SQL LIMIT and OFFSET to implement pagination:

SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0;
